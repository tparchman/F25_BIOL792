# Why Learn Basic Linux and Python Before using AI tools?

## Overview
This course will introduce you to **Linux** and **Python** as foundational tools for data science in biological sciences and other disciplines that leverage big data.  
These skills will give you the ability to:
- Work efficiently with data on your local machine or remote servers.
- Write and run scripts for analysis, automation, and reproducibility.
- Understand *what* your code is doing and *why* it works (or doesn't).

Starting this semester, we will also dicuss and explore how **AI tools** can accelerate learning and improve productivity.  

We will also emphasize that leveraging AI will enhance your research *if* or *after* you have built a basic foundation in these and other languages (e.g., R).



## Why should I learn to write code if AI can do it for me?


There are lots of reasons, but it largely comes down to clear reasons for why foundational understanding still matters:


1. **You must understand what you need to do:
1. **AI outputs aren’t always correct**  
   - AI can produce code that runs but does the wrong thing.
   - Without core skills, it’s hard to debug code, or even to know if the code is doing something remotely close to what you intend.

2. **Science requires reproducibility**  
   - To understand and explain your workflow, you will have to understand variables, structure of code, and the control of input and output.
   - Journals, advisors, funding agencies, and collaborators expect clarity.

3. **AI is an accelerator, not a crutch**  
   - AI should help produce code and analyses faster, but only if you know where you need to go and have a road map of how to get there *go faster* once you know where you’re going.
   - Without fundamentals, you will no ability to evaluate AI suggestions, adapt them to new problems, or have confidence to explain and interpret your work.

4. **You’ll need these skills without AI**  
   - Remote server access via `ssh`  
   - File management in a Unix environment  
   - Running jobs on HPC systems  
   - Troubleshooting software installations


## How AI Will Be Used in This Course

We’ll integrate AI tools **after** you’ve learned the basics, so you can use them critically and productively.

### 1. **AI for Learning**
- Explaining error messages in plain language.
- Summarizing documentation and tutorials.
- Suggesting alternative coding approaches.

### 2. **AI for Debugging**
- Finding possible sources of an error you can’t spot.
- Suggesting performance improvements.
- Providing step-by-step troubleshooting hints.

### 3. **AI for Productivity**
- Automating repetitive tasks (e.g., file renaming, directory creation).
- Generating starter code for analysis.
- Converting code between languages (e.g., R → Python).


## Our Workflow: Manual First, AI Second

In most coding exercises:
1. **Manual pass** — You write code from scratch based on what you’ve learned.
2. **AI pass** — You use AI to:
   - Improve your code.
   - Explore alternative solutions.
   - Document what changed and why.

> **Key Point:** AI is here to *extend* your knowledge, not replace it.

## A Note on Pitfalls
We’ll also look at **when AI fails** — because knowing what *not* to trust is part of using AI well.
- We’ll give examples of “hallucinated” commands or non-existent libraries.
- You’ll practice spotting and correcting these issues.


## Summary
By the end of the semester, you should:
- Be comfortable with code editors and visualizers that will help you write, organize, and run linux and python code as needed
- Be confident with basic Linux and Python workflows, and have new appreciation of how they can improve your research efficiency and depth
- Use AI tools effectively for learning, debugging, and productivity enhancement.
- Understand enough to spot when AI is wrong and/or when it is not doing what you intend.
